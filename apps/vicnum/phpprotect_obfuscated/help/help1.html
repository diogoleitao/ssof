<h4>Guessnum is part of the Vicnum project which was developed for educational purposes to demonstrate common web vulnerabilities. 
If you would like to view the entire manual which provides details on the vulnerabilites (and  answers!)
then click <a href="../manual/vicnummanual.pdf">here</a>.  If you are administering vicnum you should probably delete that file.
