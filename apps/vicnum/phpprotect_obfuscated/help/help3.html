<H3> Some options to make it harder  (or easier)

<ul>
<li>    Modify or delete this file
<li>    Modify or delete the backdoors
<li>    Dont allow indexing of the help file,  dont call the help file help1.html
<li>    Names with < > might be interesting but can trash the db, consider javascript to disable on the client, server side code to sanitize or code to check before writing to the database
<li>    Change the names of cookies and hidden fields, extra cookies and/or hidden fields are ok too
<li>    Remove encoding of a certain hidden field,  showing it in plain text will make it trivial. There are other ways to obfuscate, for example add or rotate integers
<li>    Likewise cookies content can be obfuscated
<li>    Remove the hidden field that announces admin,  maybe admin folder shouldn't be called admin
<li>    Lock down the admin folder with basic authentication, optionally make some of the admin scripts available
<li>    Let them find an htaccess user file
<li>    Code to require a different guessed number can be commented out which enables the easy back button refresh
<li>    Where and when to do the db write? if done with the perl code it is written at once,  otherwise pass it to the php program via cookies , However Perl code modules may be needed to do db queries (this is not yet done)
<li> With magic quotes off sql injection should get the entire db
</ul><p><p>
